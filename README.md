# pydza-rize
First attempt to resurect a platform game. Source from : http://sourceforge.net/projects/pydza/files/Pydza/v108/
From Lyon : France
The point of the game is to get pizzas, stomp tomatoes. It's a mario-like.

It makes me think about a different way of game design and level design.
Protagonist is a pizza dough. Stomping tomatoes give him his delicious tomato nappage. Its objective is to get in the oven.
Finding mushrooms get him bigger like Mario.
